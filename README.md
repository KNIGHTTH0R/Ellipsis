Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ellipsis is a micro-framework written in PHP for rapid application development 
and prototyping. At its core the Ellipsis project provides a developer with the
ability to create extremely simple and extremely complex rules specific to 
application routing and caching. Aside from that a few pre-built modules are 
provided that help accomplish common every-day development tasks such as unit 
testing, mysql connectivity, data repository modeling, image resizing and 
browser debugging (via firephp and chromephp); all of which you can ignore. This
project is licensed as MIT software so, put quite simply, you are free to do 
anything you want with it except claim authorship.
